Template code for CS535 Assignment 3


LINUX =========================

1. Make sure you have all dependencies installed.

Debian-based systems (e.g. Ubuntu):
	$ sudo apt install libglm-dev freeglut3-dev

Arch-based systems (e.g. Manjaro):
	$ sudo pacman -Sy glm freeglut

2. Compile
	$ make

3. Run
	$ ./assignment3




WINDOWS =======================

1. Open Visual Studio
2. Build & run

If you have linker errors with freeglut .lib or .dll files, it is
probably due to a compiler mismatch. You can download the latest
FreeGLUT at http://freeglut.sourceforge.net/.
